## Brief intro:

This application has been developed during my first university years as a part of a programming laboratory.
Its main purpose is to allow a user to create a song playlist from a repository comprised of thousands of songs. 
For each song added to the playlist, the user is capable of providing an emotional feedback based on the model defined by the Geneva Emotional Music Scale (GEMS).
To this emotional feedback, the user will be able to include a comment that further elaborates the emotions felt - or simply explains why they like the song.
This feedback will be visible to every other user within the platform.
By design, the application does not use any form of cryptography in storing the users' information; instead all the data is stored in clear inside the ".dati" files.

## The project's information:

From the Greek dances to the medieval hymns and antiphons; from the ars nova of the 1300's to the romantic season of the age of Enlightenment. Over the course of the various millennia, human beings have developed an immense fascination with music to the point where, in Romanticism, it became a pure and absolute language capable of expressing universal concepts and to draw directly from the "ineffable" and the "infinity".
One of the main reasons linked to this universal appeal lies in the immense emotional heritage that music offers to all its listeners. With this in mind, the purpose of this platform is to collect and catalog the emotional sensations experienced by our users while listening to music using the model defined by the Geneva Emotional Music Scale (GEMS): a factorial scale that divides the emotions felt by the user into nine categories of emotions:<br><br>
Amazement, Solemnity, Tenderness, Nostalgia, Calmness, Power, Joy, Tension and Sadness<br><br>
Through our platform, our users will be able to create their own playlists and populate them with one or more songs from a vast repository containing more than 380,000 songs. Each one of these songs can be annotated with emotional tags that describe the feelings perceived while listening to the song and, for each of these tags, the user will have the option to include a comment that'll give other users of the platform the chance to have an insigth on the introspectives of others and how these can be affected by the events characterizing one's past.
